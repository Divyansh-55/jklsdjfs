This is a basic website for playing pre-downloaded or added songs. The website consists of three main files:

index.html: This file contains the structure of the webpage. It includes the layout and elements such as the song name, image, and play button.

styles.css: This file contains the styles to make the webpage visually appealing. It includes CSS rules for positioning elements, colors, fonts, etc.

script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code to enable the music player functionality. It handles actions such as playing the song when the play button is clicked, displaying the song name and image, etc.


How to Use:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Add your desired songs by modifying the JavaScript code in script.js to include the file paths or URLs of your songs.
Each song should have a corresponding name and image.
Click on the play button adjacent to the song name to start playing the song.
